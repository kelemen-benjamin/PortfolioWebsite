                        <h3>Development of Omnidirection Drive Systems</h3>
                        <p>
                            This project was a continuation and advancement of the Software and Electrical Development
                            for Manual and Autonomous Systems project. This project focused on the development of
                            multiple omnidirectional drivetrains. The first drive developed was using mecanum wheels, a
                            type of wheel that provides digonal forces and allows movement in any direction using angled
                            rollers. This drivetrain had a similar design to traditional drive, 1 wheel in each corner
                            powered by individual motors, but the diagonal forces provided by the mecanum wheels allowed
                            for movement in any direction. The second drivetrain developed was a swerve drive, which
                            uses traditional wheels that can be rotated to any angle, allowing for movement in any
                            direction. Swerve drive is significantly more complex than mecanum drive, as it requires two
                            motors per wheel, one for steering and one for driving, as well as a encoder for precise
                            control of the steering. Both the electrical and software systems were extremely complex as
                            every wheel needs to move in unison to achieve omnidirecitonal movement. ADD MORE

                        <h3>Software and Electrical Development for Manual and Autonomous Systems</h3>
                        <p>
                            Developed, built, implemented, and maintained software and electrical systems for large
                            mobile robots, including drive systems, arm control, power distribution, sensor reading
                            and processing, and spacial awareness. These systems were used in a competitive robotics
                            program where high velocity impacts and damage was common, so fail-safes and quick repairs
                            were necessary. This environment encouraged modularity and adaptability, providing
                            opportunity for unique system development. The software was developed in Visual Studio Code
                            using Java and uploaded to a main cpu on the robot. This cpu wirelessly connected during
                            competitions, allowing for manual control. The software provided multiple control
                            configurations, tailored to the needs of each robot and driver. Real time sensors were used
                            as autonomous operation was often required for certain tasks. The electrical systems were
                            powered by an onboard battery and distributed through a power distribution board, which also
                            provided protection against power sugers and shorts. The drivetrains and software were
                            designed so even if motors were lost, the robot would still be functional. Multiple robots
                            were developed and competed over the course of 4 years, each with a unique design and goals,
                            but always with a focus on durability, adaptability, and performance.

                        <p>
                            Automated address verification and update system using a 3rd party geocoding API, python
                            scripts, and SQL Server Management Studio. First, a SQL job dumps the new
                            address data into a staging csv file. Next, a python script processes the csv file into the
                            3rd party API, which returns the verified address data to another csv file. If the address
                            is not verified, a new one is suggested and returned for manual review. The verified data is
                            reprocessed into the SQL database automatically, updating any misspellings and formatting
                            the address. Once the new address suggestions have been approved, they are also processed
                            into the SQL database, replacing any bad addresses. This system has been implemented at New
                            Braunfels Utilities and has significantly improved the accuracy of address data in the
                            database, reducing errors and improving efficiency in operations.
