                        <p>
                            This project will consist of the development of a robotic system for a currently
                            undetermined application. A team of 4-5 students will work together to design, build, and
                            program the robot. The goal of the project will be announced soon.

                        <h3>Automated Color Sorter</h3>
                        <p>
                            This project focused on identifying and sorting objects based on color using an arduino,
                            color sensor, a motor, and multiple servos. Ping pong balls of different colors were lifted
                            with the motor, identified by the color sensor, and sorted into bins by the servos. The
                            software was developed to allow the color sensor to adapt to any lighting conditions,
                            allowing for accurate color detection in a variety of environments. This project provided an
                            opportunity to integrate software and hardware systems to accomplish a specific task that
                            can be applied to more complex systems in the future.

                        <h3>Development of Omnidirection Drive Systems</h3>
                        <p>
                            This project was a continuation and advancement of the
                            <a href="projects.html#SDManualandAuto">Software and Electrical Development for Manual
                                and Autonomous Systems</a> project.
                            This project focused on the development of multiple omnidirectional drivetrains. The first
                            drive developed was using mecanum wheels, a type of wheel that provides digonal forces and
                            allows movement in any direction using angled rollers. This drivetrain had a similar design
                            to traditional drive, 1 wheel in each corner powered by individual motors, but the diagonal
                            forces provided by the mecanum wheels allowed for movement in any direction. The second
                            drivetrain developed was a swerve drive, which uses traditional wheels that can be rotated
                            to any angle, allowing for movement in any direction. Swerve drive is significantly more
                            complex than mecanum drive, as it requires two motors per wheel, one for steering and one
                            for driving, as well as a encoder for precise control of the steering. Both the electrical
                            and software systems were extremely complex as every wheel needs to move in unison to
                            achieve omnidirecitonal movement. This project provided an opporunity to integrate complex
                            hardware and software systems in a high performance environment.

                        <h3>Software and Electrical Development for Manual and Autonomous Systems</h3>
                        <p>
                            Developed, built, implemented, and maintained software and electrical systems for large
                            mobile robots, including drive systems, arm control, power distribution, sensor reading
                            and processing, and spacial awareness. These systems were used in a competitive robotics
                            program where high velocity impacts and damage was common, so fail-safes and quick repairs
                            were necessary. This environment encouraged modularity and adaptability, providing
                            opportunity for unique system development. The software was developed in Visual Studio Code
                            using Java and uploaded to a main cpu on the robot. This cpu wirelessly connected during
                            competitions, allowing for manual control. The software provided multiple control
                            configurations, tailored to the needs of each robot and driver. Real time sensors were used
                            as autonomous operation was often required for certain tasks. The electrical systems were
                            powered by an onboard battery and distributed through a power distribution board, which also
                            provided protection against power sugers and shorts. The drivetrains and software were
                            designed so even if motors were lost, the robot would still be functional. Multiple robots
                            were developed and competed over the course of 4 years, each with a unique design and goals,
                            but always with a focus on durability, adaptability, and performance.

                        <h3>SQL Address Verification System</h3>
                        <p>
                            Automated address verification and update system using a 3rd party geocoding API, python
                            scripts, and SQL Server Management Studio. First, a SQL job dumps the new
                            address data into a staging csv file. Next, a python script processes the csv file into the
                            3rd party API, which returns the verified address data to another csv file. If the address
                            is not verified, a new one is suggested and returned for manual review. The verified data is
                            reprocessed into the SQL database automatically, updating any misspellings and formatting
                            the address. Once the new address suggestions have been approved, they are also processed
                            into the SQL database, replacing any bad addresses. This system has been implemented at New
                            Braunfels Utilities and has significantly improved the accuracy of address data in the
                            database, reducing errors and improving efficiency in operations.

                            Recieved new data scraped from ArcGIS and automatically updated Cityworks Work Orders. Based
                            on Work Order updates, an email is sent to RT though SQL Server Database Mail, updating
                            relevent information in RT. This system has been implemented at New Braunfels Utilities and
                            has significantly reduced the time spent on manual ticket creation and management. This
                            project was later reworked to accomodate an upcoming change to the RT system and API, which
                            required a the development of a python script to process data into the RT Cloud API. While
                            implementing this change, the data flow was optimized to ensure processing of other SQL jobs
                            was not interrupted when large amounts of data were being processed.
