                <h3>Linear Algebra Paper Grader</h3>
                <p>August 2025 - December 2025<br>Texas State University</p>
                <p>
                    Graded weekly linear algebra homework assignments for a class of around 75 students. Grading
                    involved checking 4-8 problems per assignment, which required a strong understanding of linear
                    algebra concepts and the ability to provide constructive feedback to students. Feedback was given in
                    a clear and concise manner to help students understand their mistakes and improve their
                    understanding of the material.
